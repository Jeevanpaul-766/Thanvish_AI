### Sanātana Dharma Knowledge Assistant — Investor Product Brief

Note: This document focuses on product vision, market, strategy, and impact. It intentionally excludes technical implementation details, funding amounts, and delivery timelines per prior guidance, except for the high-level roadmap requested below.

## Executive Summary

Sanātana Dharma Knowledge Assistant is a learning and reference companion for Hindu scriptures, philosophy, and culture. It provides guided exploration of the Bhagavad-Gītā as the starting point and expands across the broader corpus of Sanātana Dharma. The product serves multiple audiences—children, students, teachers, scholars, families, cultural institutions, and government/NGO programs—delivering safe, accurate, and culturally authentic learning experiences across web and mobile.

- **Vision**: Make high-quality, scholar-aligned Sanātana Dharma knowledge accessible to everyone.
- **Initial Scope**: Bhagavad-Gītā (all 700 verses), with multilingual explanations and learning modes.
- **Expansion**: Progressive coverage of all major Sanātana Dharma texts, commentaries, regional languages, and audio/chanting guidance.

## The Problem

- **Access and comprehension gaps**: Primary sources are vast, complex, and dispersed across languages, traditions, and commentaries.
- **Quality inconsistency**: Online content is uneven, with limited citations and age-appropriate pedagogy.
- **Educator needs**: Institutions require structured curricula, safe content controls, and assessment tools.
- **Family demand**: Parents want trustworthy resources for children and teens that are engaging and culturally authentic.

## The Solution

An integrated, user-modeled product that provides:

- **Age-appropriate explanations** of verses and concepts, from beginner to advanced.
- **Scholar-aligned content** with citations to scriptures and recognized commentaries.
- **Multilingual support** (e.g., Sanskrit, Hindi, Telugu, English; expanding to more regional languages).
- **Safe learning pathways** with parental controls and educator dashboards.
- **Guided chanting, vocabulary building, and lesson/quiz generation** for structured learning.
- **Tailored modes** for Child, Student, Scholar, Devotee, and Parent/Educator use cases.

## How It Works (Product Functionality)

The Sanātana Dharma Knowledge Assistant delivers a guided learning experience centered on authenticity, safety, and multilingual access. The experience flows through the following user-facing stages:

- **1) Ask or Choose**: Users type or speak questions, or pick guided modules such as verse-by-verse study, stories, or themes (e.g., dharma, karma, bhakti, jñāna, yoga).
- **2) Learn with Citations**: The assistant responds with clear, age-appropriate explanations and includes transparent citations to relevant verses and recognized commentaries. Users can tap citations to explore context.
- **3) Compare Perspectives**: For scholars and advanced learners, the product presents comparative views across traditions/schools with neutral, respectful summaries.
- **4) Practice & Assess**: Learners reinforce understanding through vocabulary builders, short quizzes, chapter summaries, and reflection prompts. Educators can generate lesson plans and assessments aligned to learning outcomes.
- **5) Track Progress**: Parents and teachers can view dashboards for progress, proficiency by topic, and recommended next steps. Content filters (age, sensitivity, tradition) ensure safe learning pathways.
- **6) Multilingual Access**: Users switch between languages (e.g., Sanskrit, Hindi, Telugu, English) to deepen comprehension, with transliteration support and side-by-side explanations.
- **7) Audio Support**: Text-to-speech enables listening to verses and explanations; speech input lets users ask questions hands-free. Chanting guidance supports correct pronunciation.

This workflow prioritizes clarity, transparency (citations), and cultural sensitivity, while offering tailored depth for children, students, and scholars.
