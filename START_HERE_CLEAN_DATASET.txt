Question: "What is dharma in Bhagavad Gita?"

Answer: "Dharma in the Bhagavad Gita refers to one's duty, righteousness, 
and moral law. It encompasses the idea of living according to one's nature 
and responsibilities while following the path of righteousness. Krishna 
teaches that performing one's dharma without attachment to results is the 
key to spiritual liberation. The Gita emphasizes that each person has their 
own unique dharma based on their nature (svabhava) and position in life..."
